#+TITLE: On using Oh My Zsh with NixOS

* Why doesn't it work normally?
NixOS has an unusal approach to storing executables; in order to be able to store mutliple versions of a package, their paths are cryptic. This can lead to problems, such as scripts not working if they begin with =#!/bin/bash= (the executable isn't at that path), and with Oh My Zsh which needs to be sourced in =.zshrc=.
* Export an environment variable
In =/etc/nixos/configuration.nix=, you can export an environment variable like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  environment.variables = {
    TERMINAL = [ "gnome-terminal" ];
    OH_MY_ZSH = [ "${pkgs.oh-my-zsh}/share/oh-my-zsh" ];
  };
#+END_SRC
This makes the path of Oh My Zsh visible.
* Sourcing Oh My Zsh
In =.zshrc= you can source Oh My Zsh like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
source $OH_MY_ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
#+END_SRC
* Conclusion
NixOS's usual package management can be a pain, but usually there's a solution.
